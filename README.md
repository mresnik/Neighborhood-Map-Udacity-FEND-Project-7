# Neighborhood Map - Udacity FEND Nanodegree Project 7

This is the final project for the Udacity Front End Nanodegree. This version is
a Meeting Map allowing the user to find a meeting based on location and day of
week.

## Getting Started

When the app opens in your browser you can filter the meetings by day of week or explore the meeting locations by clicking on the markers or on the location names
in the list.

### Installing

Clone to your system and run `npm install` and `npm start`

## About the Service Worker

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). As per the [Create React App README file](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/README.md) a Service Worker is included but will only function in the production build which can be generated by running "npm run build":

* "The [`sw-precache-webpack-plugin`](https://github.com/goldhand/sw-precache-webpack-plugin)
  is integrated into production configuration,
  and it will take care of generating a service worker file that will automatically
  precache all of your local assets and keep them up to date as you deploy updates.
  The service worker will use a [cache-first strategy](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/instant-and-offline/offline-cookbook/#cache-falling-back-to-network)
  for handling all requests for local assets, including the initial HTML, ensuring
  that your web app is reliably fast, even on a slow or unreliable network."

* "The service worker is only enabled in the [production environment](#deployment),
  e.g. the output of `npm run build`. It's recommended that developers do not enable an
  offline-first service worker in a development environment, as it can lead to
  frustration when previously cached assets are used and do not include the latest
  changes you've made locally."
